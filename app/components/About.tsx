      <p className="pt-12 text-xl md:w-4/5">
        I recently graduated from the University of California, Riverside with a
        bachelor's in computer engineering. During my undergraduate education I
        spent a lot of my time researching and implementing new technologies as
        an Instructional Design Student Asssistant and a California Learning Lab
        Research Assistant. I like to think of myself of a maker and tinkerer.
        My projects cover diffrent aspects in tech that interest me. Check out
        my resume for more about me and scroll a bit more to see some of my
        work!
