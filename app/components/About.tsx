        I am a passionate problem-solver with a background in computer
        engineering from the University of California, Riverside. My career
        journey has evolved from exploring innovative technologies in academia
        to applying software engineering principles as a Manufacturing Execution
        System Consultant at Andea.
        <br />
        <br /> I&apos;m a maker/tinkerer at heart, constantly seeking to learn
        and create through projects that span various facets of technology.
