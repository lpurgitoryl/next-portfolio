CommuterCalc came about becuase I wanted to know how much my commute to school cost everyday. It uses [Mapbox's API](https://www.mapbox.com/) for forward geolocating and route maping. I also used the U.S. Department of Energy's [Fuel Economy API](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/) to grab vehicle data points based on user selection.
