Our overall goal was to simulate real-world driving situations such as driving in between lanes, turning, and speed adjustment while avoiding other cars to reach the end of track. The project design objective is to complete two vehicles (two modified RC cars) for this scenario. One **autonomous** vehicle and one **manual** controlled vehicle to simulate other drivers. Key features of the project include the autonomous vehicle with **two driving modes** (manual control and self-driving) and a radio-controlled vehicle.

Testing of our proposed design lead to feasible working prototype. The team created a custom radio-controller, our own TCP command processing communication system and worked upon well-known computer vision processing ideas to process lanes.
